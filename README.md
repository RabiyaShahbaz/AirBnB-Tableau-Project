## AirBnB-Tableau-Project

### Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the Airbnb listing data from Seattle to uncover trends and insights that can help hosts optimize their listings for better pricing, occupancy, and revenue. By leveraging Tableau for data visualization, the goal is to identify key factors that influence pricing, demand, and profitability in the Airbnb market.

### Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to:

- Identify pricing trends across different neighborhoods.
- Examine the impact of property type and number of bedrooms on price.
- Analyze seasonal trends in demand and revenue.
- Provide actionable insights for Airbnb hosts to optimize their listings.

### Data Preparation & Cleaning
Before visualization, the data underwent a cleaning process to ensure accuracy and usability:

- Handled missing values to prevent skewed analysis.
- Merged relevant datasets (listings, calendar) for a comprehensive view.
- Converted date formats and structured data for better filtering in Tableau.
